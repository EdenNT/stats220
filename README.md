# STATS220

Hi, my name is Eden. The purpose of this Repo is to keep record of each of my projects for STATS220.

## Project One: Fun with Memes!

For project one, I was asked to use **r, rStudio, and rMarkdown** to create a static and animated meme. 
To make it simpler, the assingment was broken down into the following three parts:
1. Set up a Github account and Repo *(That's this!)*
2. Create a meme:
   * Statics meme and,
   * Gif meme
3. Create a HTML project report
